## **Pattern tips**
1) Every interface should have realisation
2) Use interface, parent/abstract class for: working with lists
3) Use String or Enum in method param for: creating objects, find objects
4) Use abstract class for creating concrete factories
5) Use private constructor & private static field returning class - for creating singleton objects. Getter return field
6) Implements interface for adapter and use/return needing type
7) Use interface as field in abstract class. Constructor init
8) Use list objects for composition - one object have many ones objects
