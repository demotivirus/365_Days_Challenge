## **Pattern tips**
1) Every interface should have realisation
2) Use interface, parent/abstract class for: working with lists
3) Use String or Enum in method param for: creating objects, find objects
4) Use abstract class for creating concrete factories
5) Use private constructor & private static field returning class - for creating singleton objects. Getter return field
6) Implements interface for adapter and use/return needing type
7) Use interface as field in abstract class. Constructor init
8) Use list objects for composition - one object have many ones objects
9) Use list in interface. Use list for adding information from different classes
9.1) Use 2 interfaces in field classes
10) Use List class in this class
11) In abstract class - implements interface and use interface in field
12) Two interface fields in class 
13) Use nested class for iterator
14) One class depends on another
15) Use save for get & get for field assignment
16) Publish/subscriber - abstract class + list
17) Save state object - interface & class use each other
